## "Open folder" buttons

Every page that edits an on-disk project folder shows an **Open folder** button that reveals that
folder in the OS file explorer **on the machine running the server** (Finder / Explorer / xdg-open) —
the server is localhost, so the window appears on the user's own screen. All of them go through the
single `revealFolderNative(dir)` helper in `folderPicker.ts`; never re-implement the per-platform
open command. The canonical button is the shared `web/src/components/OpenFolderButton.tsx`
(`open: () => Promise<{ ok, path }>` + a `label` for the success toast), used by `/tickets` and
`/testcases`; `/skills`, `/mcp`, and `/templates` still carry equivalent inline copies — prefer the
shared component for any new page and fold those in when you touch them. It lives in each page's
"Editing … for `<project>`" header card next to the mono path chip + `exists`/`new` badge.

Each resource router owns its own `POST …/open` route, which resolves the project's target dir,
`mkdir -p`s it first (so a brand-new project opens cleanly), then calls `revealFolderNative`:

| Page | Folder revealed | Route | api.ts |
|------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `/skills` | `.claude/skills` | `POST /api/skills/open` | `openSkillsFolder` |
| `/mcp` | project root (where `.mcp.json` lives) | `POST /api/mcp/open` | `openMcpFolder` |
| `/templates` (`/settings`→ProjectSettingsPage) | `testing/templates` | `POST /api/templates/open` | `openTemplatesFolder` |
| `/tickets` and `/testcases` | `testing/tickets` (test cases nest under each ticket folder) | `POST /api/clickup/open` | `openTicketsFolder` |
| `/instructions` (Knowledge tab) | `testing/knowledge` | `POST /api/knowledge/open` | `openKnowledgeFolder` |
| `/instructions` (Memory tab) | `testing/memory` | `POST /api/memory/open` | `openMemoryFolder` |

The MCP `/open` route does NOT `mkdir` — the project root always exists.
